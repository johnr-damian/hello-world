Coming from p5.js, it is undeniable that there are a lot of good tutorials on how to use it.

Imagine seeing ASCII characters pouring like a liquid, a stroke of lines swaying like a tree, or a set of shapes moving like a flock of birds.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t amazing to see such complex behaviors emerge from a simple set of rules?
I found these fascinating when I was exploring projects to create for myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
