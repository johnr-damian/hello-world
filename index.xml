Description This website is a static site generated with Hugo to serve as my journal, as well as my web portfolio. Initially, this project started as a compilation of javascript files as I learn more about creative coding and web development. Then, the web portfolio combined with this project since I&amp;rsquo;ll have to show my progress as a developer.</description></item><item><title>Kokekoko</title><link>https://johnr-damian.github.io/projects/kokekoko/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 19:02:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://johnr-damian.github.io/projects/kokekoko/</guid><description>KoKeKoKo John Rhey Damian, Anngelo Rommel Guanga, Gabriel Kristoffer Salido

Description A StarCraft II bot that uses the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to manage the Micro and Macro tasks of the game. John Rhey Damian, Anngelo Rommel Guanga, and Gabriel Kristoffer developed the bot as their thesis for BS Computer Science.
KoKeKoKo uses s2client-api, a C++ library, for bot control while connected to a C# console for the implementation of artificial intelligence.</description></item><item><title>A simple 2D Ball using Three.js</title><link>https://johnr-damian.github.io/blog/creating-2d-ball/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 17:10:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://johnr-damian.github.io/blog/creating-2d-ball/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s journal, I created a simple 2D ball using Three.js as an introduction for myself in using this Javascript library.
Coming from p5.js, it is undeniable that there are a lot of good tutorials on how to use it.
However, this time I would like to use Three.js for creative coding as an exploration and out of my curiosity.
Three.js is known for its reputation as a 3D graphics library using WebGL.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://johnr-damian.github.io/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:09:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://johnr-damian.github.io/blog/introduction/</guid><description>Welcome!

I found these fascinating when I was exploring projects to create for myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
