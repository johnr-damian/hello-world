## Description

This website is a static site generated with Hugo to serve as my journal, as well as my web portfolio. 
Initially, this project started as a compilation of javascript files as I learn more about creative coding and web development. 
Then, the web portfolio combined with this project since I'll have to show my progress as a developer.
