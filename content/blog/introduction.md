Welcome! Welcome! Welcome to my blog â€” Algomorphogenesis!  
This blog was created because I wanted to compile and to catalog topics that I found interesting.  
Imagine seeing ASCII characters pouring like a liquid, a stroke of lines swaying like a tree, or a set of shapes moving like a flock of birds.  
Isn't amazing to see such complex behaviors emerge from a simple set of rules?  
I found these fascinating when I was exploring projects to create for myself.  
As such, I created this blog as my coding journal while aiding me in cataloging these topics.  
I hope that this blog would also be useful as a reference and inspire you to see the beauty in such complexities.
